# Current Session Action Log (ACTION_LOG.md)

*Purpose: This file acts as a scratchpad and tracker for the current working session. It logs ongoing changes, completed tasks, and context so that if the session is interrupted, a new agent can seamlessly resume work.*

## Current Status: Phase 5 (Rule-Based Resolution and Safe Auto-Fix Engine)

- **Completed**: Defined `Patch` model in `patch_model.py` with 3 tiers (Deterministic, Suggested, Explanation-Only).
- **Completed**: Implemented robust 5-step validation for patches: Path-escape check, Line-bounds check, old-text exact match, non-empty result guard, and Tree-sitter parseability check.
- **Completed**: Created a central `repair_registry.py` tracking repair specs with exact capabilities (autofix availability, determinism).
- **Completed**: Implemented Tier 1 deterministic fixes for Python (`yaml.safe_load`), JS/TS (`crypto.createHash`), and Java (`MessageDigest.getInstance`).
- **Completed**: Exposed a `POST /repair` endpoint in `analyze.py` routing logic via `repair_engine.py` without modifying on-disk files. Verification status is locked to `not_verified`.
- **Completed**: Wrote `validate_repair.py` performing 15 exact-match assertions to prove validation strictness and patching immutability.
- **Completed**: Integrated a non-intrusive "Suggested Fix" UI in `Results.tsx` allowing humans to review the unified diffs and candidate patches.

- **Next Steps**: Awaiting further instructions. Phase 11 is fully implemented and passes successfully.
- **Verified Phase 11 (LLM-Assisted Explanation and Patch Suggestion)**: Created `backend/llm/` containing `provider.py`, `context_builder.py`, and `llm_engine.py`. Integrated LLM-assisted patches natively into the existing Phase 5 validation pipeline (`patch_model.py`) and Phase 6 Verification Sandbox, exposing the logic securely to `backend/routes/repair.py`. Updated `Results.tsx` to handle LLM payloads ("AI-generated suggestion"). Implemented LLM pass@k evaluation in `evaluate_llm.py`.
- **Verified Phase 10 (Quality Dataset and Provenance Pipeline)**: Created `backend/dataset_pipeline/` establishing the `DatasetRecord` schema (`schema.py`). Built offline ingestion processors (`pipeline.py`) tracing exact origin states and patch validation boundaries. Enforced QA policies via `quality_checks.py`. Outputs structured JSONL/CSV/Markdown formats cleanly excluding secret content. Tested safely on synthetics without external upload or LLMs via `test_dataset_pipeline.py`. Readme updated.
- **Verified Phase 9 (Cross-Language Benchmark)**: Created `backend/evaluation/generate_datasets.py` to synthesize 25 repositories spanning Python, JS, TS, Java, and C++. Built `run_cross_language_benchmark.py` which computes TP/FP/FN across all datasets and outputs `benchmark_report.md` tracking Language Comparison, Parser Reliability, and Security metrics.
- **Verified Phase 8 (Research Evaluation Framework)**: Created `backend/evaluation/` holding `benchmark_runner.py`, `ground_truth.py`, `matching.py`, `metrics.py`, and `report.py`. Established standard `pass@k` formulas and JSON/CSV reporting without altering the user-facing web dashboard. Tests pass in `test_evaluation.py`.
- **Verified Phase 7 (Sandbox UI/UX and Optimistic Scoring)**: Upgraded `FileGraph.tsx` to include dynamic zooming (`scale=2.5`) onto the active node. Added sci-fi/cyberpunk aesthetic SVG elements (dark core, rotating dashed rings, glowing borders) and floating `<foreignObject>` HTML target labels. Bound node colors (Red, Yellow, Green) directly to the sandbox SSE states (`queued`, `running`, `passed`). Updated `App.tsx` and `SandboxVerification.tsx` with an Optimistic Scoring Engine that uses direct memory object references (Set matching) to cleanly remove verified findings from the UI and dynamically bump the overall and sub-category ISO 25010 scores based on fix severity (+5 High, +3 Medium, +1 Low).
- **Verified Phase 7 (CodeQL Adapter)**: Created `backend/analysis/external_adapters/codeql.py` to optionally execute CodeQL static analysis if installed, normalize SARIF findings to `Finding` objects, and gracefully degrade to standard analysis if unavailable. Merged deduplication logic into `analyze.py`. Exposed Source provenance in `Results.tsx`. Tests pass in `test_codeql.py`.
- **Verified Phase 6 (Sandbox Engine)**: Created `VerificationSandbox`, `runner.py`, and `test_runner.py` to enforce path-safety, tree-sitter parseability, and static/security finding resolution. Replaced the dummy verification UI in `Results.tsx` to display true sandbox telemetry. Tests run via `test_verification.py`.
- **Verified**: Confirmed that Phase 1 (Unified Analysis/Finding Model) is fully present in the codebase after the `kvs` branch merge. The `Finding` model, `rule_registry`, and structural updates are intact and fully backward-compatible with the frontend. Tests executed via `validate.py` pass.

## Phase 5 Final Report

### 1. Repairs Implemented
- **Tier 1 (Deterministic Auto-Fix)**:
  - Python: `yaml.load` → `yaml.safe_load` (`SEC-CWE-502`)
  - Python: `hashlib.md5`/`sha1` → `sha256` (`SEC-WEAK-CRYPTO`)
  - JS/TS: `crypto.createHash('md5'/'sha1')` → `sha256` (`SEC-WEAK-CRYPTO`)
  - Java: `MessageDigest.getInstance("MD5"/"SHA-1")` → `"SHA-256"` (`SEC-WEAK-CRYPTO`)
- **Tier 2 (Suggested)**:
  - Java Deserialization (`SEC-CWE-502`)
  - Python / JS Code Execution (`SEC-DANGEROUS-EXEC`)
- **Tier 3 (Explanation)**:
  - Python Unsafe Assert (`SEC-UNSAFE-ASSERT`)
  - Multi-Language Missing Exception Handling (`SEC-CWE-703`)

### 2. Supported Languages for Auto-Fix
- Python
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Java

### 3. Diff Validation Results
- The API correctly returns a `Patch` object containing unified diffs (e.g. `--- a/file.py \n+++ b/file.py`).
- 5-step strict validation blocks malformed patches (e.g., path escapes, line index out of bounds, AST-breaking edits, original text mismatch).

### 4. Tests
- Created `backend/validate_repair.py` with 15 granular checks spanning generation, immutability, parseability, and rejection. 18/18 checks pass across all 4 auto-fix capable languages.

### 5. Known Limitations
- Modifying the original repository files is intentionally disabled (sandbox pending).
- C++ does not currently have a Tier 1 deterministic fix implemented (regex-based C++ substitutions are inherently unsafe without a full semantic compiler).
